# ygodeckanalyzer
A YGO deck analyzer written in Python

Analyze your Yu-Gi-Oh! deck with this deck analyzer.

1. Download and run the script.
2. Enter the card name and quanitty. Continue to enter cards until you have entered each card in your deck.
3. The script will calculate probabilities of drawing each card with replacement and also generate 10 random sample hands in the same way.

Note that I no longer play the game and thought that calculating probabilities of drawing cards would be an interesting project when applied to something other than a 52 card deck.
